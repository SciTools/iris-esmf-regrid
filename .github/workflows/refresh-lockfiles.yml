# This workflow periodically creates new environment lock files based on the newest
# available packages and dependencies.
#
# Environment specifications are given as conda environment.yml files found in
# ``requirements/py**.yml``.  These state the packages required, the conda channels
# that the packages will be pulled from, and any versions of packages that need to be
# pinned at specific versions.
#
# For environments that have changed, a pull request will be made and submitted
# to the master branch.
