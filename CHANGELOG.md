## [0.7] - 2023-05-23

### Added

- [PR#198](https://github.com/SciTools/iris-esmf-regrid/pull/198)
  As a result of refactoring regridders to all derive from the same class,
  `_ESMFRegridder`, functionality has been added to the `ESMFAreaWeighted`
  scheme and a new scheme, `ESMFBilinear`, has been added.
  These schemes are now able to handle both grids and meshes.
  Additionally, they are also able to specify the resolution of cells in
  these grids with the `src_resolution` and `tgt_resolution` keywords.
